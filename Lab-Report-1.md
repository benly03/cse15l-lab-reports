## Lab Report 1

For the command "cd" I ran it in the edstem workspace with 3 different variations. 
1. First variation being with *no* argupments. Here is what it looks like. The first variation is considered as no arguments because as you can see I am just running the command, I am not adding anything else after the command as an input. The command still runs but instead of changing directories, the directory still stays the same.

2. Second variation being with a path to a *directory* as an argument. Here is what it looks like. With the second variation here we see that there is no actual output when running the command with "lecture1" as an argument. This is because the command is intended to change directory, which we see is the case shown by "[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$". This tells us that our working directory is now lecture1.

3. Third variation being with a path to a *file* as an argument. Here is what it looks like.

For the command "ls" I ran it in the edstem workspace with 3 different variations.
1. First variation being with *no* arguments. Here is what it looks like. The first variation is considered as no arguments because as you can see I am just running the command, I am not adding anything else after the command as an input. The command ls only returns "lecture1" as the only file present because it is in the home directory, therefore lecture1 is the only folder present.

2. Second variation being with a path to a *directory* as an argument. Here is what it looks like. Now that we have given it a directory argument, we can now see all of the files and folders in the lecture1 folder.
