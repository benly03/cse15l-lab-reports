For the command "cd" I ran it in the edstem workspace with 3 different variations. 
1. First variation being with *no* argupments. Here is what it looks like. The first variation is considered as no arguments because as you can see I am just running the command, I am not adding anything else after the command as an input.

2. Second variation being with a path to a *directory* as an argument. Here is what it looks like. With the second variation here we see that there is no actual output when running the command with "lecture1" as an argument. This is because the command is intended to change directory, which we see is the case shown by "[user@sahara ~/lecture1]$"
